### Research & Planning Log
Name of Student: Liliia Kryvelova

Name of Project: Image Classification with ML.NET and Windows Machine Learning

Project's Purpose or Goal: Create an application that allows the user to upload the picture and get the response to what is on the image.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- Set up Model Builder;
- Traine Model;
- Evalue the results;
- Add the model to the solution;
- Create client;
- Organize functionality for uploading images;
- Connect the client to the server or realize utilization of the existing trained model;

Language: C#;
Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio, ML.NET Model Builder Visual Studio Extension;

Already I have a trained model wich can recognize the animal on it. The next step is to create a client which should use a trained Model.

* 9:00: start researching ideas for the ways how to implement the project in the correct way
* 9:32: exploring the approaches for implementing the Neural Networks
* 10:39: Reading additional literature about implementing and exploring types of NN
* 10:46: Start to read about Deep learning on the official site of Microsoft
* 11:32: Work on installation Visual Studio
* 12:00: Successfully create a ML project in Visual Studio  
* 12:23: What types of problems can I solve by using Model Builder?
You can use Model Builder to solve many common machine learning problems, such as:

* _Categorizing data: Organize news articles by topic._
* _Predicting a numerical value: Estimate the price of a home._
* _Grouping items with similar characteristics: Segment customers._
* _Recommending items: Recommend movies._
* _Classifying images: Tag an image based on its contents._
* _Detecting objects in an image: Detect pedestrians and bicycles at an intersection._
* 12:31: Choose a scenario: Classifying images
* 12:35: MB is supported for Image classification - Local CPU, Local GPU, Azure GPU
