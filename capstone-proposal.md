You can use Model Builder to solve many common machine learning problems, such as:

* _Categorizing data: Organize news articles by topic._
* _Predicting a numerical value: Estimate the price of a home._
* _Grouping items with similar characteristics: Segment customers._
* _Recommending items: Recommend movies._
* _Classifying images: Tag an image based on its contents._
* _Detecting objects in an image: Detect pedestrians and bicycles at an intersection._
* 12:31: Choose a scenario: Classifying images
* 12:35: MB is supported for Image classification - Local CPU, Local GPU, Azure GPU
